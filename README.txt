Iris Species Predictor

	This project is a simple machine learning app built with Streamlit that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on user input for the flower's measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). It uses a Random Forest classifier trained on the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.

Purpose
	The goal of this project is to showcase how machine learning models can be deployed into an interactive web application using Streamlit. The app takes four flower measurements as input and predicts which of the three Iris species the flower belongs to: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

Project Structure
	The project is organized as follows:

	iris_project/
	├── app.py                 # Streamlit app
	├── model.py               # Model training and loading
	├── predictor.py           # Prediction logic and input validation
	├── utils.py               # Error handling or helper functions
	└── data/                  # Folder for saving model data (optional)

	app.py: The main Streamlit application that serves as the user interface for input and output.

	model.py: Contains the logic for training and saving the machine learning model.

	predictor.py: Contains the logic for predicting the Iris species based on the user's input.

	utils.py: Contains helper functions like error handling.

	data/: Optional directory to store the trained model (iris_model.pkl).

Requirements

	To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

	Python 3.6 or higher
	streamlit
	scikit-learn
	pandas
	numpy
	joblib

Install Dependencies
	You can install the required dependencies using pip:

	bash
	Copy
	Edit
	pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

Running the App
	Clone the Repository: First, clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.

	Navigate to the Project Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the iris_project directory.

	Run the Streamlit App: Use the following command to start the Streamlit app:

	bash
	Copy
	Edit
	streamlit run app.py
	Interact with the App: After running the command, a new tab will open in your browser, displaying the Iris flower species prediction app. You can input the flower's measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and click "Predict" to get the species prediction.

How the Model Works
	The model is trained using the Iris dataset provided by scikit-learn. It is a simple classification task where the features are the flower measurements, and the target variable is the species of the Iris flower. The model is a Random Forest Classifier that is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated for accuracy.

	The model is saved as a .pkl file (iris_model.pkl) in the data/ folder. If the model is not already saved, it will be trained on the spot when the app is first run.

File Breakdown
	model.py: Contains the load_model() function that attempts to load a pre-trained model. If the model does not exist, it trains a new one and saves it as iris_model.pkl.

	app.py: The main Streamlit app. It collects user input for the flower measurements and calls the predict_species() function from predictor.py to display the prediction.

	predictor.py: Contains the predict_species() function, which makes the prediction based on the user-provided input and the loaded model.

	utils.py: Contains utility functions like handle_error(), which prints errors to the console if something goes wrong during app execution.

Troubleshooting
	Model Not Found: If the model isn't found, the app will train the model automatically. Make sure the data/ folder exists before running the app.

	Missing Dependencies: Ensure that you have all the required dependencies installed. You can check the dependencies with the command pip freeze.
